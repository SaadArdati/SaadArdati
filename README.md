## A little window into my life

I started off as a Minecraft developer, making mods with my team and became a Java developer ever since.

In the past 6 years of Team Wizardry's journey, we've made the following mods:

- [Wizardry](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/wizardry-mod), our flagship mod in which you delve into spell
  creation and become a wizard. It currently has over **5.5 million downloads** on CurseForge alone.
- [LibrarianLib](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/librarianlib), our home-brewed mod helper library which
  offers a large collection of powerful features for modders. It currently has over **14 million downloads**.
- [Shotguns & Glitter](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/shotguns-glitter). A fun modjam mod which adds
  Guns with weird and wild bullets.
- [Refraction](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/refraction), an mod that was originally made in a modjam
  but has since been expanded into a full-fledged mod that is all about light manipulation using mirrors, prisms, 
  and lasers.

After 6 years of Minecraft modding, I started to learn Flutter, and have since become a full-time Flutter developer
with over 4 years of experience, 3 years of which are professionally as a developer at @Codelessly.
